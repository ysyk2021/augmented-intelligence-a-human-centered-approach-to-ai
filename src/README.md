# Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a significant part of our lives, transforming industries and changing the way we work, learn, and interact with each other. However, as AI continues to advance, there are growing concerns about its impact on society, particularly in terms of job displacement, bias, privacy, and ethical considerations.

Augmented intelligence (AI) is an approach that seeks to address these concerns by enhancing human capabilities rather than replacing them. By integrating AI tools and systems into human decision-making processes, augmented intelligence can improve accuracy, efficiency, and overall outcomes while also promoting transparency, fairness, and responsibility.

In "Augmented Intelligence: A Human-Centered Approach to AI," we explore the principles and practices of augmented intelligence and how they can be used to create effective and responsible AI systems. Drawing on examples from various industries and domains, we examine the benefits and challenges of augmented intelligence and provide strategies for designing and implementing AI tools and systems that meet the needs and expectations of users.

Throughout the book, we emphasize the importance of human-centered design and governance frameworks that ensure responsible AI use. We also discuss the ethical considerations involved in AI implementation and how they can be addressed through transparent and accountable practices.

Whether you're a designer, developer, business leader, or policy maker, "Augmented Intelligence: A Human-Centered Approach to AI" offers valuable insights and practical guidance for creating AI systems that enhance human capabilities and promote social and economic progress.
