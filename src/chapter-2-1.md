In this chapter, we will explore the concept of augmented intelligence and provide a clear definition of what it is.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years, but it is still unable to perform tasks without significant human input. Augmented intelligence, on the other hand, is a technology that combines human intelligence with artificial intelligence to enhance human capabilities. Augmented intelligence is not about replacing humans with robots or machines; instead, it is about using AI as a tool to help humans work better, faster, and more efficiently.

Definition of Augmented Intelligence
------------------------------------

Augmented intelligence, also known as intelligence amplification (IA), is the use of technology to enhance human cognitive abilities such as perception, reasoning, decision-making, and communication. It involves combining human intelligence with artificial intelligence to create a symbiotic relationship between humans and machines. The goal of augmented intelligence is to enable humans to make better decisions, solve problems more effectively, and achieve better outcomes.

Unlike traditional AI systems, which aim to automate tasks and replace human labor, augmented intelligence systems are designed to augment human abilities, rather than replace them. Augmented intelligence systems are often referred to as "smart tools" that provide humans with real-time feedback, insights, and recommendations to improve their performance.

Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, augmented intelligence is a game-changer in the world of technology and innovation. It has the potential to revolutionize the way we work, learn, and live our lives. By combining human intelligence with artificial intelligence, augmented intelligence creates a powerful partnership that enables us to achieve greater results than ever before. In the following chapters, we will explore how organizations can implement augmented intelligence in a human-centered way to drive business outcomes and enhance human performance.
